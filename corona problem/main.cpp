//Q1) Virus Outbreak (100 Marks)
//
//
//In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking
//the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the
//virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are
//infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are
//POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the
//current blood composition B of the person.
//
//
//POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?
//
//If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.
//
//
//Example:
//
//Virus Composition, V = coronavirus
//
//Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus
//
//
//The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V.
//
//
//
//The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a
//program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.
//They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the peopleï¿½s current
//blood composition. Can you help them?
//
//
//Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.
//
//Input Format
//The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V
//
//The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N
//
//Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi
//
//
//
//
//Constraints
//1<= N <=10
//
//1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5
//
//
//
//Output Format
//For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line
//
//Sample TestCase 1
//
//Input
//
//coronavirus
//3
//abcde
//crnas
//onarous
//
//Output
//
//NEGATIVE
//POSITIVE
//NEGATIVE
