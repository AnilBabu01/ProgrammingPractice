  //You are in locked room for 24 hrs.

//there is also a mouse in room
//-> 4 bottle of milks & 1 of them is poisonous
//-> to survive for 24 hrs, you need to drink atleast 3 bottles of milk
//-> also, to check for poisonous milk, you are allowed to test milk on mouse
  // (by giving 1 drop of milk to mouse)

//-> poison will show its result after 10hrs of drinking.

//-> SO, HOWCOME YOU CAN DRINK 3 BOTTLES OF MILK TO SURVIVE.
